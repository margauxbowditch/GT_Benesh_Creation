# Notation Translation Task: OpenPose to BMN Bit Vector

This repository contains the code for our rule-based notation translation task which can map pose estimated skeleton data into our BMN bit vector representation.
This code generates the ground-truth data necessary for training our computer vision models for automated notation translation.

### Illustration of the translation process for mapping OpenPose skeletons to BMN:
